# Free walking tour

Made during Technigo Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a site with forms, accordion and a hero image/video. 

## The process

I started mobile first, tried CSS grid for the first time to layout the site. 
I put some effort in styling the form and accordion with CSS, added the hero video in a video tag. 
Next I made it somewhat responsive for tablet and desktop. 
Had I more time I would refine the grid layout, add more validation to the form and make a selection for days as well as times.
